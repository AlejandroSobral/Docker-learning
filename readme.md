# Tiny Docker learning series

In this tiny docker learning series, I'll be creating a web-based Flasked website that gets content from a database. It will start from a single Dockerfile and step into a Docker Compose case.

### 0: First steps
Deploy a simple python Flask web server

### 1: Keep moving
Deploy a tiny containerized MongoDB.

### 2: Interacting
Connect to the DB from the web-home-page and interact
